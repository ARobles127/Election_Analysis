# Election_Analysis
Colorado State Congrssional Race 

## Overview of Election Audit
In this project we are helping Tom and Seth complete an election audit for the Colorado Board of Elections. In order to complete this task we will use programming languages like Python and interpreter softwares like VS Code to write algorithms that will assist the confirmation and analysis of the election results. Our goal for this project is to deliver clear and unbiased results as well as a report that is easy to understand for non technical people and that can  be used for future projects. 

The tasks that need to be completed for the election audit are listed below. 
1. Total number of votes cast
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
3. Total number of votes each candidate received
4. Percentage of votes each candidate won
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote

### Resources
The data provided is stored in a CSV file, which is often used to export large datasets from websites or databases. To inspect this data we will use Python that will allow us to create scripts, perform mathematical operations, use decision and repetition statements and produce screen outputs. In order to edit and save our project we will need software that allows us to write and execute scripts, for that we will use Visual Studio Code or VS Code. Lastly, we will use Github to create a repository where Tom and Seth can have access to our code to provide feedback and assistance.  

- Data Source: election_result.cvs	
- Python 3.7.6
- Visual Studio Code 1.67.1
- Github 

## Election-Audit Results

  - 369,711

- Number of votes and Percentage of total votes for each county
  - Denver: Total votes 306,055. 82.8% 
  - Jefferson: Total votes 38,855. 10.5% 
  - Arapahoe: Total votes 24,801. 6.7% 

- County with the largest number of votes
  - County: Denver
  - Percentage: 82.8%
  - Total Votes : 306,055

- Number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate receive
  - Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% 
  - Diana DeGette: 73.8%
  - Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1%

- Winner of the election:										
  - Diana DeGette, who received  73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes
  
## Election-Audit Summary 
Python is a programming language that has many applications and its low maintenance and debugging process can be easier to perform. For this project we created a series of codes and algorithms to showcast the winner of the congressional race; these same lines of code can be applied in future races with only minimal changes. 

For example, for this specific project we were given a csv file, for any future application this file will have to be changed and stored in the resources folder. The script can also be modified and adapted to the type of election being conducted.
